The revised `.gptignore` file specification can incorporate the concept of "grouped headers" where consecutive headers share the same pattern rules until a new pattern or header is encountered. This can simplify managing similar patterns under multiple profiles or conditions without redundancy. Here's how you could define this functionality in the file format:
## Revised .gptignore File Format 
 
- **Comments:**  Lines starting with `#` are considered comments and ignored in parsing.
 
- **Headers:**  Lines within `[...]` brackets define headers. These are profile names that group specific ignore patterns.
 
- **Grouped Headers:**  Consecutive headers without intervening patterns are grouped together, meaning they share the same subsequent patterns until a new pattern or header disrupts the group.
 
- **Patterns:**  Patterns listed under headers or globally apply to the ignoring mechanism, similar to `.gitignore`.

## Example with Grouped Headers 


```ignore
# Global patterns
pattern1

# Grouped headers for shared patterns
[Header_1]
[Header_2]
pattern2
pattern3

# Single header for specific patterns
[Header_3]
pattern4
pattern5
```
 
- `pattern1` is global and applies to all profiles.
 
- `pattern2` and `pattern3` apply to both `Header_1` and `Header_2`.
 
- `pattern4` and `pattern5` are specific to `Header_3`.

## Python Implementation Adjustments 
The Python function to parse the `.gptignore` file needs adjustment to handle grouped headers. The modified `parse_gptignore_file` function might look like this:

```python
def parse_gptignore_file(ignore_file_path, profile_names=None):
    global_patterns = []
    profiles_patterns = {}
    active_profiles = []

    with open(ignore_file_path, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            line = line.strip()
            if not line or line.startswith('#'):
                continue
            if line.startswith('[') and line.endswith(']'):
                # Starting a new profile block, flush previous active profiles
                if line != active_profiles[-1] if active_profiles else None:
                    active_profiles = []
                current_profile = line[1:-1]
                active_profiles.append(current_profile)
                if current_profile not in profiles_patterns:
                    profiles_patterns[current_profile] = []
            elif active_profiles:
                for profile in active_profiles:
                    profiles_patterns[profile].append(line)
            else:
                global_patterns.append(line)

    # Prepare the output dictionary
    output_patterns = {'global': global_patterns}
    for profile in profile_names or []:
        output_patterns[profile] = global_patterns + profiles_patterns.get(profile, [])
    return output_patterns
```
This code adjusts for grouped headers by managing a list of active profiles and assigning patterns to all active profiles until the list is reset or a new pattern is introduced. This method efficiently handles grouped and individual profile scenarios in `.gptignore` files.
