The revised `.gptignore` file specification can incorporate the concept of "grouped headers" where consecutive headers share the same pattern rules until a new pattern or header is encountered. This can simplify managing similar patterns under multiple profiles or conditions without redundancy. Here's how you could define this functionality in the file format:
## Revised .gptignore File Format 
 
- **Comments:**  Lines starting with `#` are considered comments and ignored in parsing.
 
- **Headers:**  Lines within `[...]` brackets define headers. These are profile names that group specific ignore patterns.
 
- **Grouped Headers:**  Consecutive headers without intervening patterns are grouped together, meaning they share the same subsequent patterns until a new pattern or header disrupts the group.
 
- **Patterns:**  Patterns listed under headers or globally apply to the ignoring mechanism, similar to `.gitignore`.

## Example with Grouped Headers 


```ignore
# Global patterns
pattern1

# Grouped headers for shared patterns
[Header_1]
[Header_2]
pattern2
pattern3

# Single header for specific patterns
[Header_3]
pattern4
pattern5
```
 
- `pattern1` is global and applies to all profiles.
 
- `pattern2` and `pattern3` apply to both `Header_1` and `Header_2`.
 
- `pattern4` and `pattern5` are specific to `Header_3`.
