## Configuration File Specification

### Overview

This specification describes the format and structure of the JSON
configuration file used to manage file inclusions and exclusions based on
various profiles and environments. The configuration file supports a default
set of rules, profile-specific rules, inheritance of settings, and
environmental variables.

### Format

The configuration file is a JSON array where each element represents a set of
rules that can either apply globally (default) or conditionally (profiles).
Each object in the array can specify files to include and exclude, and may
define additional attributes such as a profile name, tags, inheritance, and
environment-specific settings.

### Schema Details

  1. **Default Configuration:**

     * The first object in the array, without a `profile_name`, serves as the default configuration.
     * **Attributes:**
       * `include` (array): Paths to include, supporting environment variable substitution.
       * `exclude` (array): Paths to exclude, supporting environment variable substitution.
  2. **Profiles:**

     * Subsequent objects may define `profile_name` to apply settings conditionally based on the active profile.
     * **Attributes:**
       * `profile_name` (string): The identifier for the profile.
       * `tags` (array): Optional tags for additional categorization or filtering.
       * `inherits` (string): Optional attribute to inherit rules from another profile.
       * `environment` (object): Defines environment variables specific to the profile.
       * `include` and `exclude` (arrays): Paths to include or exclude, which may override or complement inherited paths.
  3. **Environment Variables:**

     * Any object can specify paths using environment variables (e.g., `${CONFIG_DIR}`).
  4. **Comments:**

     * Using string keys that start with `//` allows adding comments to the configuration for better readability and maintenance. Note: JSON standards do not officially support comments. Ensure your JSON parser or handling mechanism can safely ignore these keys.

### Examples

#### Basic Configuration with Comments:

    
    
```json
   [
        {
            "//": "Default configuration for all environments",
            "include": [
                "${CONFIG_DIR}/reports/*.txt",
                "${CONFIG_DIR}/images/*.png"
            ],
            "exclude": [
                "${CONFIG_DIR}/reports/archive/",
                "${CONFIG_DIR}/tmp/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
```

#### Development Profile:

    
    
```json
    [
        {
            "profile_name": "development",
            "include": [
                "${CONFIG_DIR}/dev/reports/*.txt",
                "${CONFIG_DIR}/dev/images/*.png"
            ],
            "exclude": [
                "${CONFIG_DIR}/dev/reports/archive/",
                "${CONFIG_DIR}/dev/tmp/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
```    

#### Production Profile with Inheritance and Tags:
    
    
```json
[
        {
            "profile_name": "production",
            "tags": ["common", "all"],
            "inherits": "development",
            "environment": {
                "STAGING_DIR": "/staging/setting/"
            },
            "include": [
                "${STAGING_DIR}/prod/reports/*.txt",
                "${STAGING_DIR}/prod/images/*.png"
            ],
            "exclude": [
                "${STAGING_DIR}/prod/reports/archive/",
                "${STAGING_DIR}/prod/tmp/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
```   

### Implementation Considerations

  * Ensure the JSON parsing mechanism can ignore or process keys starting with `//` as comments.
  * Implement logic to handle inheritance, resolving which rules to apply first and which to override.
  * Ensure that environment variables and paths are dynamically resolved at runtime based on the current profile and settings.

This specification aims to provide a flexible yet robust framework for
managing file paths across various deployment environments and conditions,
leveraging JSON for easy human readability and machine parsability.
